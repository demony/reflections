When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you want to share your code to other people.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because it's not safe for purpose of consistency of my code

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

		Forks is cloning on github (for now github knows relations between forked repositories)
		Cloning is a coping of repository to another place
		branches is a local slice of current code state for new feature or other development to prevent modification of other code
